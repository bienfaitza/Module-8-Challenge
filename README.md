- Extract data from different sources using Python.
- To Clean and transform data using Pandas.
- Use regular expressions (Regex) to parse data and to transform text into numbers.
- Load data in PostgresSQL database.

The project included extracting a dataset(files) from Kaggle, then transforming the data into a usable dataset for a "hacking competition." Once the data was transformed and narrowed in scope for the hack-a-thon, the DataFrames were loaded into PostgresSQL.
